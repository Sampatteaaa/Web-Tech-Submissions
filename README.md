## Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to document and organize all web development activities conducted during classroom practical sessions. Each file demonstrates practical implementation of core web technologies, including:

- HTML5 – Structure and layout
- CSS3 – Styling and design
- JavaScript – Interactivity and behavior

This submission showcases my coding proficiency, active classroom engagement, real-time problem-solving, and progressive mastery of concepts over the semester.

## HTML Programs

**Directory:** `HTML/`

These programs introduced the foundational elements of webpage creation and were practiced during initial classroom lectures.

### Files and Concepts:

- `attributes1.html` / `attributes2.html`
  - Understanding global attributes like `id`, `class`, `style`, and custom attributes.
- `hyperlink.html`
  - Demonstrates internal, external, and anchor links.
- `list.html`
  - Covers ordered, unordered, and nested lists.
- `table1.html` / `table2.html` / `timetable.html`
  - Construction of tables using `<tr>`, `<td>`, `rowspan`, and `colspan`.
- `web.html`
  - A basic structured web page using headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags.

These programs built a strong foundation in semantic HTML, essential for scalable web development.

## CSS Programs

**Directory:** `CSS/`

These files focus on design, layout, and visual styling, marking the second phase of my learning.

### Files and Topics:

- `css1.html`, `css2.html`, `css3.html`, `css4.html`
  - Used internal and external CSS to style a table template, applying properties like font family, size, border collapse, background colors, alignment, and spacing.
- `tshirt.html`
  - Designed a product card (e.g., a t-shirt) with styled content to simulate an e-commerce product preview layout.

These programs helped me understand how content and design work together to enhance the user interface and experience of a webpage.

## JavaScript Programs

**Directory:** `JavaScript/`
**Subdirectories:** `bulb/`, `frames/`, `gates/`, `password/`

These programs demonstrate basic interactivity, client-side scripting, and logic building using JavaScript.

### Key Files and Their Purposes:

- `1.html`, `2.html`
  - Basic syntax practice and simple document manipulation.
- `calculation.html`
  - Arithmetic calculator that accepts input and performs operations dynamically.
- `email.html`
  - Validates email input fields using JavaScript.
- `password.html` + `password/` folder
  - Password field validation, toggling show/hide functionality using event listeners.
- `bulb/`
  - `bulb.html`: ON/OFF image toggling to simulate an electric bulb using DOM manipulation.
- `gates/`
  - `gates.html`: Logical gates simulator using conditionals, representing AND, OR, NOT logic with checkboxes and JavaScript.
- `frames/`
  - `frames.html`: Practiced creating multi-frame HTML layouts with navigation.

### Additional JavaScript Learning:

- **Directory:** `Understanding-JS-arithmetic/`
  - `arithmetic.html`
    - Focused on practicing JavaScript arithmetic operations, reinforcing core programming logic.

These programs enabled me to create real-time interactions and dynamically change content, styles, or behavior using scripting logic.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this Web Technology course, I have gained a practical understanding of how modern websites are built. This course has strengthened my technical skills and enhanced my ability to think creatively and solve problems effectively.

Here's what I've learned:

- **HTML**: I learned to structure webpages using semantic tags, forms, tables, multimedia, and hyperlinks, enabling me to build clean, accessible, and SEO-friendly web layouts.
- **CSS**: I mastered styling techniques, including selectors, colors, backgrounds, borders, spacing, positioning, and responsive design using display models like inline-block, flexbox, and grid.
- **JavaScript**: I developed skills in making websites interactive through DOM manipulation, form validation, event handling, logical conditions, and real-time element interactions (e.g., toggling a bulb or simulating logical gates).
- **Web Page Integration**: I gained the ability to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create cohesive, interactive web experiences, understanding their roles as structure, style, and behavior.
- **Debugging & Best Practices**: I improved my code readability and maintainability through consistent practice, commenting, and troubleshooting during lab sessions.
- **Confidence & Creativity**: I now feel confident in developing web pages and small applications from scratch, sparking my interest in front-end development and UI/UX design.

## Future Scope

This repository lays the foundation for my continued growth in web development. Moving forward, I plan to explore advanced frameworks like React or Vue.js, deepen my understanding of backend technologies, and build more complex, full-stack applications. I also aim to focus on accessibility and performance optimization to create user-friendly, efficient websites.

## Special Acknowledgment

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Professor Yogesh for his exceptional guidance throughout this course. His clear explanations, patience in addressing questions, and hands-on teaching approach made complex topics accessible and engaging. His mentorship has not only helped me build technical skills but also inspired me to pursue web development with confidence and enthusiasm.

Thank you
